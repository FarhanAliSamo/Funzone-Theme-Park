                <h1>MICKEY MOUSE</h1>
                <p>
                    “When people laugh at Mickey Mouse, it's because he's so human; and that is the secret of his popularity. I only hope that we don't lose sight of one thing — that it was all started by a mouse.”
                    ―FunZone
                    <br><br>
                   <b> Mickey Mouse</b> is an animated cartoon character created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. A cheerful and plucky anthropomorphic mouse, Mickey made his first public appearance in Steamboat Willie, on November 18, 1928. Estimated as standing 2' 3" (68.58 centimeters) and weighing 23 pounds (10 kilograms), Mickey is easily identified by his round ears, red shorts, white gloves, and yellow shoes. He speaks in a falsetto voice, and his speech is typically infused with 1930s slang like "swell" and "gee". The essence of Mickey’s character is that of an underdog who, despite being small and vulnerable, overcomes larger-than-life adversity through quick wit and a can-do spirit.
                    <br><br>
                    Mickey was popularized by his long-running short film series. His simplistic, "rubberhose" design allows for both relatable emotion, and exaggerated physical gags. Mickey’s versatility, meanwhile, enables him to slip into any profession, location, or time period, while maintaining his core characteristics. Mickey steadily branched into other mediums over the years, beginning with a comic strip by cartoonist Floyd Gottfredson in 1930. In 1940, Mickey made his feature-length film debut with Fantasia, for which he was given his modern redesign by animator Fred Moore. In the 1950s, Mickey became a television mainstay with the premiere of 1955's The Mickey Mouse Club, as well as an icon for the Disney theme parks with the opening of Disneyland. Mickey has also featured prominently in critically acclaimed video games such as 1990's Castle of Illusion and the Kingdom Hearts series.
                    <br><br>
                    Upon his inception, Mickey rapidly rose to the pinnacle of American culture, becoming the most popular and recognizable cartoon character in the world, and the prime influence of following cartoons.[31] The character was especially treasured by Walt Disney, himself. The two were widely regarded as "alter-egos" by peers and historians,[32][3] a perception supported by Walt originating Mickey’s voice. Disney once attributed his success to the advent of Mickey, famously proclaiming that, “it was all started by a mouse”.

                    <p>
                        “Gosh, Minnie, you've always been a princess to me.”
                        ―Mickey Mouse
                        <br><br>
                       <b>Minnie Mouse</b> is an animated anthropomorphic mouse character created by Walt Disney. She is the longtime girlfriend of Mickey Mouse, known for her sweet disposition, large head bows, and polka-dotted dresses. She is also identified by her signature catchphrase, “Yoo-hoo!”, which she affectionately calls out as a greeting. Inspired by flapper girls of the 1920s, Minnie first appeared in the short Steamboat Willie, released on November 18, 1928.
                       <br><br>
                       Minnie is traditionally depicted as a starving musician, singer, and songwriter. Her classy, yet no-nonsense demeanor serves as a foil to the troublemaking Mickey. Throughout the 1930s, Minnie was a frequent participant in Mickey’s adventures, often serving as a damsel-in-distress whom finds herself kidnapped by Peg-Leg Pete. In the 1940s, Minnie was relegated to bit parts in cartoons starring her kitten, Figaro, and Mickey's dog, Pluto. By the 1950s, she faded into obscurity altogether, and remained dormant for three decades.
                       <br><br>
                       Minnie was revitalized with the premiere of the 1988 television special Totally Minnie, her first starring role. Since then, she has endured as one of The Walt Disney Company’s most popular and significant characters. Typically partnered with Minnie's best friend, Daisy Duck, she has headlined her own cartoons, such as in Mickey Mouse Works, Minnie's Bow-Toons, and Electric Holiday. Paul Rudish's series of shorts sought to develop Minnie's comedy by highlighting her impulsivity and spunk while maintaining her endearing demeanor.
                       <br><br>
                       In 2018, Minnie was recognized for her contributions to animation with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Recently, she has also appeared as a fashion icon, appearing at events, such as New York Fashion Week and the Fashion Awards in Los Angeles, in addition to serving as the figurehead of the Rock the Dots apparel and merchandise promotions—inspired by her affinity for polka dots.

                <h1>NICK WILDE</h1>
                <p>
                    “Never let them see that they get to you.”
                    ―Nick Wilde to Judy Hopps
                    <br><br><br>
                   <b> Nick</b> Wilde is the deuteragonist of Disney's 2016 animated feature film, Zootopia. He is a con-artist fox in the city of Zootopia who finds himself compelled to aid Officer Judy Hopps, a rabbit, in her investigation. Despite their differences, Nick forms a friendship with Judy, who helps him realize he can be more than his stereotype. Nick makes good on this lesson by becoming a police officer and Judy's partner.
                   <br><br>
                   Nick came from a poor background living with his mother (his father is never seen or mentioned). As a child, Nick had a dream of joining the local Junior Ranger Scouts, for the goal of receiving genuine acceptance. When he was eight or nine years old, his mother scraped up enough money to buy a brand new scout uniform, allowing him the opportunity to join the division. Though he was the only predator there, Nick attended his initiation with confidence and zeal, but unknowingly walked into a trap. The "initiation" turned out to be a cruel prank and Nick was ridiculed, shoved to the ground and muzzled by the other scouts for being a fox (as foxes are considered among the vilest and most untrustworthy species of mammals in the Zootopia world). After running outside to escape his tormentors, Nick broke down in tears, developing a triggering fear of muzzles and dislike towards prey and specist mammals. From that moment forward, Nick vowed to never expose his true vulnerability to others, resulting in the fox presenting himself as stoic and unflappable.

                    ―Judy Hopps' catchphrase
                    <br><br><br>
                    “When I was a kid, I thought Zootopia was this perfect place where everyone got along and anyone could be anything. Turns out, real life's a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker. Real life is messy. We all have limitations. We all make mistakes. Which means―hey, glass half full―we all have a lot in common. And the more we try to understand one another, the more exceptional each of us will be. But we have to try. So no matter what type of animal you are, from the biggest elephant to our first fox, I implore you: Try. Try to make the world a better place. Look inside yourself, and recognize that change starts with you. It starts with me. It starts with all of us.”
                    `―Judy Hopps
                    <br><br>
                   <b> Officer Judy Hopps</b> is the protagonist of Disney's 2016 animated feature film, Zootopia. The first rabbit officer of the Zootopia Police Department, Judy is determined to make the world a better place while breaking misconceptions about other species. Teaming up with a fox named Nick Wilde, she sets off on her first case but discovers a sinister conspiracy is at play.
